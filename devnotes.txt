PROJECT: FarmCounter (WoW Addon)
VERSION: 7.2 (Hotfix / MenuUtil Update)
STATUS: Working as of Patch 11.2.7 (The War Within)

FILE STRUCTURE:
1. FarmCounter.toc       -> Loads Localization.lua -> FarmCounter.lua.
                            Uses "SavedVariablesPerCharacter".
                            Points to IconTexture: Logo.png.
2. Localization.lua      -> Texts for DE, EN, FR, ES, IT, RU.
                            Includes "Midnight" Pre-Support (EXP_11).
3. FarmCounter.lua       -> Core logic, GUI, Events, Goal System.
4. Logo.png              -> Custom Icon for the addon list.

FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Item Scan (C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant):
   - Scans for ClassID 7 (Tradeskill Goods).
   - Filters relevant SubClasses:
     * Ores (7), Herbs (9)
     * Leather/Cloth (5, 6)
     * Housing (1, 11, 13) -> IMPORTANT: SubClass 13 required for new materials!
     * Enchanting (12), Cooking (8)
     * NEW: Gems (4), Elementals (10)

2. Controls & Menu (MenuUtil):
   - API Change: "EasyMenu" was removed in TWW.
   - Replacement: Uses "MenuUtil.CreateContextMenu" for the right-click menu on the Minimap button.
   - Features: Left-Click (Toggle Window), Right-Click (Filter Menu), Right+Drag (Move Button).

3. Goal System:
   - Storage: In "FarmCounterDB.goals" (Per Character).
   - Alert: Plays SoundID 8959 (Raid Warning Horn) + Chat Message.
   - Background Mode: Alert triggers even if the window is closed.

UPDATE GUIDE (e.g., WoW Midnight):
1. .toc File: Update Interface number.
2. Localization.lua:
   - Check if "EXP_11" (Midnight) is named correctly.
   - Add new expansion "EXP_12" if necessary.
3. FarmCounter.lua:
   - Check if Blizzard introduced new SubClasses for Class 7.
   - If menu errors occur: Check if "MenuUtil" API has changed.

KNOWN "FIXES":
- Icons: Uses text paths (strings) instead of FileIDs to prevent "black icons".
- Menu Crash: Caused by deprecated "EasyMenu" function -> Fixed by "MenuUtil" implementation (v7.2).
- Housing: SubClass 11 (Parts) and 13 (Materials) are essential for current Housing items.
